# pandas-challenge
The Pandas challenge was quite difficult at times but the repitition was beneficial. 

I was able to work with my tutor to figure out the "groupby" code and they were very helpful pointing out the string to integer conversion.  

I also used chatgpt to correct a few of my codes if they weren't running properly. 

Overall, a fun and insightful challenge!
